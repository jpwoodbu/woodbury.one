# Privacy Policy

Jonathan Woodbury built the Unofficial Emotiva Remote app, which provides the
SERVICE.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to
use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of
information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we
collect are used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or
share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

This Service does not collect any personally identifiable information. The only
information retrieved by this Service is from the Emotiva devices it connects
to, e.g. device name. Such information is used only for processing within the
Service and not collected by me in any way.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus I am
striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party
link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not
operated by us. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
of these websites. I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for
the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
services.

## Children's Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly
collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, I 
immediately delete this from my servers. If you are a parent or guardian and
you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please
contact us so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, I advise you to
review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are
effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
